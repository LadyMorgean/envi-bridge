orginal creator https://github.com/Envi-Scripts I don't claim to have written this completely myself you must have their script and then take my edits to allow it to work with QS Inventory again. 

Add QS inventory to inventory folder 
Edit bridge.lua to include my edits or just replace it with mine 
restart envi-bridge 
restart any scripts that uses the bridge and shouldn't have any errors now
